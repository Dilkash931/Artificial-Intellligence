In this completed project, we have successfully built an email spam detector using Python. We utilized machine learning techniques to train our spam detector to classify emails into spam and non-spam categories.

To begin, we preprocessed the dataset by converting the text and paragraphs in the emails into numerical representations, as machines understand and process numbers more effectively. Next, we split the data into training and testing sets. For the classification task, we employed the logistic regression model, which operates on binary values. In our case, the binary values represented ham/spam (1/0) labels.

After training the logistic regression model with the dataset, we proceeded to test its performance. We used the test data to evaluate the model's ability to classify emails accurately, determining whether each email belongs to the ham or spam category.

Overall, this project demonstrates the successful implementation of an email spam detector using machine learning techniques, particularly logistic regression. By leveraging these techniques, we can effectively identify and categorize emails, enabling users to prioritize their attention and protect against potential spam messages.
